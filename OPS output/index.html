    <h1>Different Conditions Output.</h1>
    <p>var a = 5 , b = 10 , c = "5" , x = a . So now if we take example a == x the answer will be</p>
    <script>
     let a = 5 ;
     let b = 10 ;
     let c = "5" ;
     let x = a;
     document.write(a == x);

    </script>
    <br>

    <span> a == c  this condition is true as the type will not be count.<br> 

        a === c; this condition is false because c is string and a is number.<br>
        
        a == x; this condition is true.<br>
        
        a != b; as the sign says that a is not equal to b which is true.<br>
        
        a > b;  false a is smaller.<br>
        
        a < b; true.<br>
        
        a >= b; false. not greater and not equal<br>
        
        a <= b; true. as b is greater.<br>
    
        
        a >= c; as they are same in number so its true.<br>
        
        a <= c; true
    </span>
