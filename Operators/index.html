    <h1>Arithmetic Operators..</h1>
    <p>In this example, x, y, and a are variables. x = 5 and y = 10 and z= 15 we have to find a in different operators
<br>

<script>
    // divided by 2 
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 15;
let a = x % 2;
document.write(x % 2);
</script> <span>is remainder</span>


<p>
Answer will be 5 if subtraction is executed by same method as checked in console
for multiplication we use *. so x * y is 50 and shown in console.
y / x for division. for addition x + y and in the end x++ an x--
Here x++ is postfix in this expression 1 is added after one step.. means
in console if we write x++ and then enter the previous value of x which is
5 is shown.. then we retype x and then console will show the new value of x. 
same in case of x-- one number is subtracted after execution..the new value
will be 4.</p>
