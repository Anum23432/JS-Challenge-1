    <h1>Logical And Assignment Operators. </h1>
    <p>Assignment operators in which we assign the value to variables.<br> If = signs comes with any arithmetic operator it will give a new value to <br> the variable and that will be assignment operator.<br>Logical operators are of three types;
         <ul>
             <li> And && operators(if both conditions are true the function will be performed).</li>
             <li>Or || operators (if only one condition will be true the function is executed.)</li>
             <li> NOT ! operators(it will give the opposite output of the condition.)</li>
        </ul
    ></p>
    
    <script>

        let a = 5; 
        let  b = 10;
        let c = "5";
        var x = a;
    if(a < b && a <= b){
        document.write(true);
    }


    </script>
    <br>

<p>
So , through this function as we have changed the conditions and checked function is working or not.<br> If we change the logical operator between them it will work according to its specificity.<br>And in not operator the function is working in totally opposite.
